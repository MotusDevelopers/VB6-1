What is MapKeyboard?
----------------------------------------------------
MapKeyboard is a free program to remap your keyboard. Using MapKeyboard, you can alter any key on your keyboard to function as a different one or altogether disable it as well. This is an essential tool for laptop users and other people with keyboards whose keys differ from the standard 101 keyboard layout. The changes made are universal across all applications & games and best of all, MapKeyboard does not even need to be actively loaded in memory.
