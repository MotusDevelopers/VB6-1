Title: Keyboard State
Description: Demonstrates how to use the keybd_event and MapVirtualKey API methods to manage keyboard state. Basically this code will also change the lights on the keyboard for Num, Scroll and Cap Locks. Please note, I did not write this code so no need to vote, just thought it would be very useful to people rather thatn using the SetKeyboardState and GetKeyState
